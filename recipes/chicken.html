    <h1>Peri Peri Chicken</h1>

        <p>This peri peri chicken recipe features a great spicy marinade for an African dish that's great for a barbecue. Nice with salad and fries, but I like adding it to a pita with salad and garlic Greek yogurt (3/4 cup Greek yogurt and 3 cloves of crushed garlic with finely chopped chives). Don't go on a date, though; it gives you wicked garlic breath!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>¼ cup paprika</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons hot chili powder</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons chopped fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>4 bone-in chicken breast halves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
        <h4>step 1</h4>
        <p>Stir together lemon juice, paprika, chili powder, garlic, ginger, and salt in a large bowl until well combined. Add chicken; rub until well coated and marinate in the refrigerator for 3 hours.</p>
        <h4>step 2</h4>
        <p>Stir together lemon juice, paprika, chili powder, garlic, ginger, and salt in a large bowl until well combined. Add chicken; rub until well coated and marinate in the refrigerator for 3 hours.</p>
    
        <h4>step 3</h4>
        <p>Place chicken onto the preheated grill; discard marinade. Cook, turning occasionally, until skins are slightly charred and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of chicken should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C)</p>
